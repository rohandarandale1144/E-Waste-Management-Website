        <h1>How to Recycle E-Waste Responsibly</h1>
        <p>
            Recycling e-waste responsibly is essential for protecting the environment and conserving valuable resources.
            By ensuring that your old electronics are recycled properly, you help reduce the negative impact on
            ecosystems and contribute to a more sustainable future. Here are steps you can follow to make sure your
            e-waste is disposed of safely and responsibly.
        </p>

        <h2>Steps for Responsible Recycling</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify E-Waste:</strong> Start by gathering all your obsolete or broken electronics, including
                mobile phones, laptops, tablets, televisions, printers, and other electronic devices. This includes not
                only large items but also smaller accessories like chargers, headphones, and cables that are no longer
                in use.</li>

            <li><strong>Research Recycling Options:</strong> Use online resources, such as e-waste recycling websites or
                apps, to find out what items are accepted for recycling in your area. Different centers may accept
                different types of e-waste, so it’s essential to confirm before dropping off your items.</li>

            <li><strong>Find a Certified Recycling Center:</strong> Locate a nearby recycling center using our
                interactive map below. Make sure the recycling center you choose is certified by recognized
                organizations such as e-Stewards or R2 (Responsible Recycling) to ensure that the e-waste will be
                processed in an environmentally safe way.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare Your Devices:</strong> Before recycling, remove any personal data from devices like
                smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Be sure to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Back up important files and perform a factory reset on the device to erase all personal data.</li>
                    <li>Remove batteries (if removable), as they often need to be recycled separately to prevent leaking
                        hazardous materials.</li>
                    <li>Properly pack your devices, especially fragile items like screens, to avoid damage during
                        transport to the recycling center.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Drop Off or Request Pickup:</strong> If possible, drop off your e-waste at the nearest recycling
                center. Some services also offer free or low-cost pickup options, especially for larger items like
                televisions and home appliances. Be sure to follow the center’s guidelines for accepted materials and
                disposal processes.</li>

            <li><strong>Consider Trade-In or Donation:</strong> Before recycling, check if your devices can still be
                reused or refurbished. Many manufacturers and retailers offer trade-in programs where you can exchange
                old electronics for store credit. Additionally, donating functioning electronics to schools, charities,
                or shelters can extend the lifespan of your devices and benefit those in need.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why Recycling E-Waste Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Properly recycling e-waste helps prevent the release of harmful chemicals like mercury, lead, and cadmium
            into the environment. These substances can contaminate soil, air, and water, causing long-term damage to
            ecosystems and human health. By recycling, we can also recover valuable materials like gold, silver, and
            copper, which reduces the need for mining new raw materials and saves energy in the manufacturing process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, recycling programs create jobs in the green economy and support sustainable practices that
            contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.
