        <h1>Impact of E-Waste on the Environment</h1>
        <p>
            Electronic waste, or <strong>e-waste</strong>, poses a severe and growing threat to the environment. As more
            electronic devices become obsolete, improper disposal is leading to significant ecological damage. Toxic
            chemicals released from e-waste harm not only ecosystems but also human health by contaminating the air,
            soil, and water around us.
        </p>

        <h2>Environmental Hazards of E-Waste</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soil Contamination:</strong> Hazardous substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and other
                heavy metals found in electronics can leach into the soil over time. This not only degrades soil quality
                but also contaminates the food we grow, impacting human health.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> When e-waste is improperly dumped, chemicals from the waste can seep
                into groundwater or run off into rivers and oceans, severely affecting aquatic ecosystems. Marine life
                can absorb these toxins, which can eventually make their way into the human food chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> In many places, e-waste is burned to recover valuable materials,
                releasing harmful dioxins and carcinogens into the air. The combustion of plastics and metals
                contributes to air pollution, which poses health risks to nearby communities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Human Health Impact</h2>
        <p>
            The harmful effects of e-waste go beyond environmental damage; they also pose serious health risks. Workers
            involved in informal recycling sectors are often exposed to dangerous chemicals without proper safety
            equipment. Communities living near e-waste disposal sites may suffer from respiratory illnesses,
            neurological damage, and even cancer due to prolonged exposure to toxins.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Recycling is Important</h2>
        <p>
            Proper e-waste recycling is essential for mitigating these hazards. By recycling electronics responsibly, we
            can prevent the release of harmful substances, reclaim valuable materials such as gold, silver, and copper,
            and reduce the overall environmental impact. Recycling not only helps conserve natural resources but also
            significantly reduces the energy consumption associated with manufacturing new electronic devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, e-waste recycling creates job opportunities and promotes a circular economy where products are
            reused, refurbished, or broken down into their components, fostering more sustainable consumption patterns.
